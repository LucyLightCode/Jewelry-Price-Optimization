# Machine Learning for Jewelry Price Optimization

**Project Description:**

This project aims to predict jewelry prices using machine learning, allowing Gemineye Emporium to optimize prices and reduce reliance on expensive gemologists.

**Methodology:**

The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, encompassing the following phases:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Data Modeling
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Deployment

**Tools:**

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* CatBoost
* MLflow

**Data:**

The project uses a jewelry dataset containing information on various jewelry characteristics, including target gender, metal type, gem type, and price.

**Modeling:**

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

* Linear Regression
* Extremely Random Forest (ExtraTrees)
* Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
* CatBoost

**Results:**

CatBoost emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the highest R-squared (R2) score and a relatively low RMSE.

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning for jewelry price optimization. Gemineye Emporium can leverage the developed model to make informed pricing decisions and enhance market competitiveness.

**Recommendations:**

* Adopt CatBoostRegressor for Jewelry Price Prediction.
* Focus on Data Quality.
* Explore Feature Engineering.
* Monitor and Retrain the Model.
* Implement a Deployment Strategy.
